# 🥣 Cereal Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Cereal Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive Power BI project aimed at evaluating and comparing popular breakfast cereals based on their nutritional content and brand performance. The objective is to help users make informed decisions about cereal choices and provide insights into health-focused product analysis. The dashboard utilizes data visualization and DAX-powered metrics to surface patterns in calories, sugar, protein, fiber, manufacturer influence, and overall ratings.

This project serves as a demonstration of data storytelling, business intelligence reporting, and dashboard design using Power BI.
